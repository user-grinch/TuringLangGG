# TuringLangGG

TuringLangGG is a Python-based interpreter for the Turing programming language. It aims to provide a simple and intuitive implementation of the core features of Turing, including variables, expressions, conditionals, loops, and functions. TuringLangGG allows users to write and run Turing programs efficiently.

## Features

- **Variables**: Supports variable declarations and assignments.
- **Expressions**: Allows mathematical and logical expressions.
- **Conditionals**: If-else conditions to control program flow.
- **Loops**: `loop`, `repeat`, `for` and `while` loops to repeat code execution.
- **Functions**: Support for defining and calling functions.
